# Java Order Handler
Java cash handler exercise taken from An Introduction To Object-Oriented Programming With Java, Chapter 5 Exercise 30, 5th Ed., Thomas Wu.
Just like Java Cash Handler (https://github.com/cemreis0/java-cash-handler) this code also exists in the introduction-to-java-oop repository but it's worth creating a separate one for this exercise.
